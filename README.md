# Logiverse

The logiverse is a HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL network of social media sites. 

## Sign up

## Is that it? 

Well, no.

<br>

The logiverse is built for the [tadi web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft6xOAijwFo), which means that it's really really really radically simple.

Because of this, there are lots of different logiverse sites. Here are some of them: 

- [Login](https://todepond.com/lab/login)
- [Loggo](https://svenlaa.com/playground/loggo/)
- [Login Redux](https://login.rossilaz.xyz/)
- [LOGIN](https://cute-catgirl.github.io/login/)
- [Logon](https://evolved.systems/logon/)

There are also various different clients. All of the sites above have their own client, and there's also:

- [Logarithm](https://tristie.org/logarithm/)
- [Loft](https://github.com/cute-catgirl/Loft)

Some people have created their own [command-line client](https://xoxo.zone/@annika/113136710954037798) too.

Join us! We're exploring and experimenting with how far we can push this thing :)
